 <li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Explain in detail the potential impact of the three (3) selected malicious attacks.</li>

 <li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Propose the security controls that you would consider implementing in order to protect against the selected potential malicious attacks.</li>

 <li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Analyze three (3) potential concerns for data loss and data theft that may exist in the documented network.</li>

 <li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Explicate the potential impact of the three (3) selected concerns for data loss and data theft.</li>

 <li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Propose the security controls that you would consider implementing in order to protect against the selected concerns for data loss and data theft.</li>
